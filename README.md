# Stochastic Processes Lecture Notes

This repository contains my lecture notes on **Stochastic Processes**, providing a structured and comprehensive guide to the subject. Both PDF and LaTeX (`.tex`) files are included for each chapter to facilitate reading, learning, and editing.

## Course Reference

These notes are based on the course **Stochastic Processes** offered in **Fall 2024**, taught by **Professor Hamid R. Rabiee**. The course explores stochastic processes as a random process, discussing their various forms and examples. Additionally, related topics such as estimation theory and hypothesis testing are comprehensively covered.

For more details about the course, visit the [official course website](https://stoch-sut.github.io/).

## Table of Contents

### Chapters Included So Far:

1. **Review Probability and Introduction to Stochastic Processes**  
   A recap of probability concepts and an introduction to the fundamental ideas of stochastic processes.

2. **Stochastic Processes and Stationary Stochastic Processes**  
   Overview of stochastic processes and a deeper dive into stationary stochastic processes.

3. **Ergodic Stochastic Processes, Stochastic Analysis of LTI Systems, and Power Spectrum**  
   Discussion on ergodicity, stochastic analysis techniques for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, and the concept of power spectrum.

4. **Poisson Processes and Point Processes**  
   Exploration of Poisson processes and their applications, along with a broader understanding of point processes.

5. **Gaussian Processes**  
   An introduction to Gaussian processes and their applications in modeling and prediction.
